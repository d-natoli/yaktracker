Yaktracker!!!
=============

A site to track Dave & Doug's trip from London to Mongolia!
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here's the code for the website I created to track my friends' trip on the Mongol Rally.
It scrapes a twitter account for locations, then uses google maps to display the output.
Before the rally begun, users could place bets on where Dave and Doug would meet there untimely death.
Now you can just send them messages.
